ðŸ”§ DC Motor Control Project with PIC18F4580 & L293Dâš¡
Excited to share my recent project where I controlled a DC motor using a PIC18F4580 microcontroller along with basic components like a switch, battery, resistor, and the L293D motor driver.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:
Microcontroller: PIC18F4580
Motor driver: L293D for bidirectional motor contro Input control via switch
Powered by a battery source Current limiting using resistor
Programmed using Embedded C in MPLAB IDE 8.v92

This project helped me understand the integration of hardware components with firmware logic, especially in real-world embedded applications like motor control systems.

ðŸ’¡ A great step forward in learning how microcontrollers interact with external devices and sensors!
